# DNS Extra Credit Lab

This is an extra credit lab, you are to fill in the blanks in the skeleton code. As this is extra credit, you cannot ask for help on this assignment. 
You must work on it independently. This also means TAs will not help verify your code and work. All the necessary hints and types have been embedded in the Skeleton Code as Comments. 

Note this file is deliberately lowercase 'dnsClient.py' to avoid accidental overwrites of the main DNS lab.

Have Fun!
